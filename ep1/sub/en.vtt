<i>There are several unforgettable moments
throughout our lives.</i>

3
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.520 
<i>No.</i>

4
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.840 
,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.480

DUAN

8
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.120 
Busted, thief.

9
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.360 
<i>This is my second time</i>

10
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.720 
<i>looking at him so closely.</i>

11
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.720 
<i>Time does have magic</i>

12
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.960 
<i>drawing us closer in height</i>

13
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.600 
<i>and distance.</i>

14
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.960 
In the Pythagorean theorem,

15
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.720 
A squared plus B squared

16
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.920 
equals the square of C, the longest side.

17
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.520 
Sang Zhi.

18
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.360 
Sang Zhi!

19
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.160 
What are you staring at?

20
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.600 
Just now, a mother bird

21
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.480 
brought back food to feed baby birds.

22
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.160 
The two baby birds were fighting for it.

23
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.160 
Then the mother bird flew away

24
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.560 
with the food.

25
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.600 
They were then stunned

26
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.480 
for one or two minutes.

27
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.560 
They were frozen.

28
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.480 
Be quiet, everyone.

29
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.840 
Sang Zhi.

30
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.720 
Pay attention

31
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.920 
and look at the board.

32
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.880 
Sit down.

33
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.000 
Let's read the third question aloud.

34
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.720 
-"A triangle ABC
-"A triangle ABC

35
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.720 
-with side lengths
-with side lengths

36
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.600 
-of 5 cm, 13 cm, and 12 cm."
-of 5 cm, 13 cm, and 12 cm."

37
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.680 
Obviously,

38
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.200 
we can see that the longest length

39
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.520 
is C.

40
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.080 
So

41
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.400 
how do we get this?

42
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.480 
Equals 5â€¦

43
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.840 
The conditions given

44
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.440 
are that the side lengths are A and B.

45
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.760 
What kind of triangle is this?

46
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.240 
-"A right triangle."
-"A right triangle."

47
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.839 
Multiply the base by the height
and divide by two.

48
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.880 
Look at this.

49
00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.880 
You've picked this up, right?

50
00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.960 
Next question.

51
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.560 
Angle one equals angle two.

52
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.360 
Angle three is 108 degrees.

53
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.760 
Sang Zhi!

54
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.640 
Sang Zhi.

55
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.000 
Where was I just now?

56
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.040 
Angle four equals 72 degrees.

57
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.720 
I haven't gotten there yet.

58
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.880 
Where were you just now?

59
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.000 
Silence.

60
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080 
Silence!

61
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.400 
Angle one equals angle two,

62
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.640 
so line AB is parallel to line CD.

63
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.960 
As they are parallel lines,

64
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.720 
same-side interior angles
are supplementary.

65
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.600 
-So angle three is--
-Stop.

66
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.400 
It's not about the question.

67
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.600 
It's your attitude!

68
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.920 
Sang Zhi, tomorrow,

69
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.560 
have your parents come in.

70
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.720 
Sit down.

71
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.480 
Let's continue.

72
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.120 
Angle one equals angle two.

73
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.920 
This means that these two straight lines

74
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.920 
are parallel to each other.

75
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.360 
The interior angles are supplementary.

76
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.680 
Therefore, calculate angle four.

77
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.480 
GRADE 8, CLASS 1

78
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.240 
-Let's go home.
-Go!

79
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.960 
I'm sorry about earlier.

80
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.240 
I pointed to the wrong line

81
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.080 
and the teacher caught you again.

82
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.480 
Your mom has already come in twice

83
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.960 
in just half a month.

84
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.400 
I don't know
if I rubbed him the wrong way.

85
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.960 
But when you replied

86
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.080 
with his own question,

87
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160 
I felt like punching you,

88
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.520 
let alone Mr. Chen.

89
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.040 
Don't you think his voice is hypnotizing?

90
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.520 
I would've dozed off

91
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.840 
if I didn't do something.

92
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.920 
You're right.

93
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.400 
But why do you always get caught by him?

94
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720 
It never happened to me.

95
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.840 
Ask her if she wants
to go to the bookstore.

96
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.840 
Let's go.

97
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.160 
Do you want to go to the bookstore?

98
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.040 
Why?

99
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.200 
Fu Zhengchu invited us

100
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.480 
and also some boys from his class.

101
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.040 
Let's go together.

102
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.520 
Why do you want to go?

103
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.520 
To buy study materials.

104
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.560 
Are you coming along?

105
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.520 
No.

106
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.720 
Coming?

107
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.480 
<i>Sang Yan, you've been away for a while.</i>

108
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560 
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

109
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.840 
<i>Can you come back tomorrow?</i>

110
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.160 
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

111
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.480 
So are you coming?

112
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.960 
No, I'm not going.

113
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.200 
But they're waiting over there.

114
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.160 
Let's go, please.

115
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.640 
Go ahead if you want.

116
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.760 
I'm not in the mood today.

117
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.520 
Is it because your parents have to come?

118
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.880 
What do you plan to do?

119
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.360 
They're not coming.

120
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.960 
Even so,

121
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.200 
Mr. Chen will call them.

122
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.080 
That's why I asked my brother to come.

123
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.840 
He replied.

124
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.560 
I'm leaving.

125
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.080 
-Wait.
-Sang Zhi.

126
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.920 
Bye.

127
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.280 
Sang Zhi, why are you leaving?

128
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.760 
Aren't you coming to the bookstore?

129
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.480 
Is Sang Zhi not coming?

130
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.960 
The teacher scolded her.

131
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.200 
She's feeling down.

132
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.440 
Are her parents coming again?

133
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.640 
Her parents come more often
than yours, Fu Zhengchu.

134
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.720 
Shame on you.

135
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.360 
Mind your own business.

136
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.480 
Why won't he help me?

137
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.040 
<i>Sang Yan, you're heartless.</i>

138
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.640 
<i>Sure.</i>

139
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.560 
SILLY DOG

140
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.560 
<i>You abandoned me
after going to university!</i>

141
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.560 
<i>Sure.</i>

142
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.360 
<i>You're leaving me to struggle by myself!</i>

143
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.520 
<i>Sure.</i>

144
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.960 
ANGRY, GOING TO BE ANGRY, ANNOYED

145
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.720 
How am I going to face Dad and Mom?

146
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.760 
I won't let it go that easily, Silly Dog.

147
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.960 
What should I do?

148
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.600 
Doggy.

149
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.600 
Come here.

150
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.600 
You're so adorable.

151
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.520 
Do you know? Sang Yan, that silly dog,

152
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.640 
left me on my own and even angered me.

153
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.200 
You think he's hateful, right?

154
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.880 
Listen, you mustn't grow into
a big silly dog like him

155
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.200 
in the future.

156
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.640 
Though you're a small silly dog,

157
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.440 
don't grow up to be like him, okay?

158
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.880 
You're good in this way.

159
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.760 
Are you going to make me angry too?

160
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.080 
Is that how it is?

161
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.680 
I'm sure you'll become a big silly dog,

162
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.840 
just like Sang Yan.

163
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.000 
Zhizhi, welcome home.

164
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.720 
Mom.

165
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.520 
Listen.

166
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.480 
-The--
-Hold on.

167
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.840 
Take the fruit upstairs.

168
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.760 
Sang Yan is back.

169
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.680 
He's back?

170
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.040 
Yes.

171
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.560 
Be careful when you go upstairs.

172
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.720 
-Okay.
-He--

173
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.720 
She's rather weird today.

174
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.160 
Sang Yan!

175
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.480 
What's up?

176
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.640 
Did you get plastic surgery?

177
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.760 
Come over and see

178
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.240 
if the results are good.

179
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.840 
What's wrong with you?

180
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.600 
Are you amazed by my dashing look?

181
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.080 
You're more narcissistic than me,
Sang Yan.

182
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.080 
Shut up.

183
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.480 
Little demon, tell me now.

184
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.680 
What have you done this time?

185
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.720 
No, I did nothing.

186
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.480 
No?

187
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.160 
How is that possible?

188
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.280 
Why else would you say you miss me

189
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.480 
and ask me to come home?

190
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.560 
Sang Yan, something did come up.

191
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.760 
Is she your sister, Sang Yan?

192
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.200
{\an8}Do you think she's my daughter?

193
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.000 
Sang Yan.

194
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.560 
Who is he?

195
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.280 
My roommate, Duan Jiaxu.

196
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.160 
Hello, little girl.

197
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.720 
I'm Duan Jiaxu.

198
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.040 
I'm your brother's friend.

199
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.800 
Do we look alike?

200
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.560
{\an8}The bathroom is over there.

201
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.960
{\an8}Take a look in the mirror.

202
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.120 
Who looks like you?

203
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.120 
Really?

204
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.040 
But your sister just asked me

205
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.720 
if I got plastic surgery.

206
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.800 
What do you mean?

207
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.040 
Sang Yan, didn't you say

208
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.920 
you weren't coming back today?

209
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.160 
Little demon,
don't tell me you mistook him for me

210
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.760 
and a tweaked version of me at that!

211
00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.520 
Little demon,

212
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.960 
what do you think about every day?

213
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.240 
What is on your mind?

214
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.200 
Youâ€¦

215
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.480 
Stop!

216
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.320 
Isn't plastic surgery
the obvious conclusion?

217
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.720 
Look at your ugly face.

218
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.320 
Besides, Mom didn't tell me

219
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.320 
you brought a friend.

220
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.720 
Moreover, he was the only one in the room.

221
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.400 
Naturally, I mistook him for you!

222
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.000 
Keep it down!

223
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.200 
Why should I?

224
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.120 
You're too loud!

225
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.880 
You can't beat me.

226
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.800 
Here, little girl.

227
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.400 
Have some fruit.

228
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.320 
Don't bother with him.

229
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.720 
Duan Jiaxu,

230
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.280 
do you want to shower before leaving?

231
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.560 
No. Go get changed so we can go.

232
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.080 
All right. I'm going to get changed.

233
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.280 
-Hurry up.
-Wait!

234
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.320 
Sang Yan, I need your help.

235
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.280 
Move.

236
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.800 
I'm in a rush to get plastic surgery.

237
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.040 
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.040 
Too bad.

239
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.320 
Are you leaving me for dead?

240
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.400 
I don't even know what you're asking for.

241
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.120 
Shoot. What is it?

242
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.960 
Please say yes first.

243
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.280 
I can't do that.

244
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.320 
Are you going to report me to Mom?

245
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.320 
Mom!

246
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.760 
Mom!

247
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.680 
Mom!

248
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.920 
Mom!

249
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.640 
You were laughing just now. What happened?

250
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.720 
Mom, Sang Yan beat me!

251
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.640 
Mom!

252
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.320 
-Mom, Sang Yan beat me!
-Sang Yan.

253
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.120 
Can you not do that to your sister?

254
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.520 
Mom!

255
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.880 
Stop that.

256
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.200 
Why shush her? How dare you bully her!

257
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.920 
Mom, Sang Yan beat me.

258
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.680 
-He said Iâ€¦
-All right, dear.

259
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.800 
Don't cry.

260
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.920 
How could you?

261
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.160 
I'll teach him a lesson.

262
00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.480 
Come with me.

263
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.880 
-What's going on? Youâ€¦
-I didn't touch her.

264
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.280 
Did you say you didn't?

265
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.320 
I saw it with my eyes.

266
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.280 
Xiaoduan is here.

267
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.160 
-How could you do that?
-I won't do it again.

268
00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.280 
You're her big brother!

269
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.560 
Never again!

270
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.760 
Good, you know you're wrong.

271
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.960 
Can you get me a tissue?

272
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.120 
Do you and your brother

273
00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:41.960 
do this often?

274
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.240 
It's nothing. Don't worry.

275
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.880 
Mom doesn't actually scold him.

276
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.760 
We've done this since we were kids.

277
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.240 
Didn't you ask Sang Yan for help just now?

278
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.520 
Why did you frame him then?

279
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.440 
Wait, little girl.

280
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.840 
Hold back your tears.

281
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.680 
What about this?

282
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.320 
I'll talk to Sang Yan

283
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.440 
and ask him to help you.

284
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.600 
What do you need?

285
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.680 
It won't work. He won't help me now.

286
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.560 
No, Sang Yan isn't that petty.

287
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.520 
Jiaxu, do you have time tomorrow?

288
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.520 
Tomorrow?

289
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.960 
Yes, tomorrow.

290
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.720 
What if I say

291
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.920 
I'm not free?

292
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.880 
No, you can't.

293
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.880 
You must be available.

294
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.040 
Why?

295
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.360 
If you hadn't told Sang Yan

296
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.920 
about the plastic surgery thing,

297
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.160 
I wouldn't have fought with him

298
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.880 
and he would have helped me.

299
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.320 
You might have a point.

300
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.160 
So tell me.

301
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.560 
What do you need me to do?

302
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.960 
Can you please

303
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.960 
pretend to be my brother?

304
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.640 
My real brother.

305
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.160 
And then,

306
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.480 
meet with my teacher.

307
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.079 
Are you in trouble at school?

308
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960 
What have you done?

309
00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:19.680 
Can I not tell?

310
00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.640 
Sure.

311
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.480 
Then

312
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:23.880 
I'm busy tomorrow.

313
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.480 
I wasn't paying attention in class.

314
00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.240 
I got called to answer a question.

315
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.200 
I answered correctly,

316
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.120 
but he wanted to meet with my parents.

317
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.160 
Do you expect me to buy that?

318
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.800 
I'm telling the truth.

319
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.400 
If you don't believe me,

320
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.000 
you'll find out tomorrow when you go.

321
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.200 
Even if I lie to you now,

322
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.000 
the teacher will tell you tomorrow.

323
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.200 
True.

324
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.280 
Little demon.

325
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.560 
Get out.

326
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.200 
Can't I stay here?

327
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.520 
I have to get changed.

328
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.680 
Weren't you doing it outside?

329
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.320 
I want to do it here now.

330
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.840 
If so, he should leave the room too.

331
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.760 
I don't think he wants to watch either.

332
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.680 
You two, get out.

333
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.960 
I'm going to undress.

334
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.440 
It took you long enough.

335
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.960 
Close the door.

336
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.600 
Jiaxu, are you coming or not tomorrow?

337
00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.920 
I've told you everything.

338
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.160 
Why don't you ask Sang Yan?

339
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.360 
No way!

340
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.600 
I framed him just now.

341
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.360 
If I were to tell himâ€¦

342
00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.560 
Sang Yan isn't like that.

343
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.640 
What are you mumbling about, little demon?

344
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.040 
A light bulb burned out.

345
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.120 
Mrs. Sang, I'm leaving.

346
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.440 
Leaving? Are you not staying for dinner?

347
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.880 
I've prepared many dishes.

348
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.480 
I have a part-time job later.

349
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.440 
Enjoy your meal.

350
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520 
All right.

351
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.800 
What about you, Sang Yan?

352
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.680 
I'm not eating since he's not.

353
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.920 
Fine. Take this trash out for me.

354
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.920 
Take the boxes out first.

355
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.240 
Hurry up.

356
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.400 
I'll do it, Mrs. Sang.

357
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.960 
No, of course not. Iâ€¦

358
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.200 
It's no big deal.

359
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.280 
I'm leaving.

360
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.440 
All right, thank you.

361
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.720 
Come for dinner next time.

362
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.960 
-Sure, Mrs. Sang.
-Good.

363
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.360 
-Bye, Mrs. Sang.
-Where are the boxes, Mom?

364
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.720 
They're right there.

365
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.360 
Bye, little girl.

366
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.200 
See you next time.

367
00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.080 
Bye?

368
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.320 
Jiaxu, are you leaving so soon?

369
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.560 
It's getting late.

370
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.120 
Why don't you stay for dinner?

371
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.080 
Maybe next time.

372
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.800 
When is the next time?

373
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.440 
Duan Jiaxu.

374
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.640 
Don't waste your breath
with an elementary student.

375
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.040 
You're an elementary student.

376
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.040 
I'm in eighth grade.

377
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.640 
Gosh, you're an eighth-grader. Impressive.

378
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720 
Are you in eighth grade?

379
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.160 
So,

380
00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.080 
you're 14?

381
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.200 
Are you trying to say that I'm too short

382
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.360 
to be in eighth grade?

383
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.520 
Rightfully so. That's what he meant.

384
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.880 
No, that's not what I meant.

385
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.200 
Don't get me wrong.

386
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.720 
I won't argue with you.

387
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.160 
Anyway, I'll grow taller.

388
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.040 
No worries at all. You won't grow more.

389
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.000 
But it's good for you.

390
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.840 
At 30, people will think that you're 18.

391
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.840 
So is it because you're tall

392
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.280 
that people assume you're my dad?

393
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.960 
Bye.

394
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.480 
You're 14.

395
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.600 
What school do you go to?

396
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160 
Xuri Middle-High School.

397
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.160 
Grade 8, Class 1.

398
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.640 
And your name?

399
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.640 
I'm Sang Zhi.

400
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.520 
Sang Zhi?

401
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.040 
Yes, "Zhi" as in innocence.

402
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120 
Duan Jiaxu.

403
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.880 
-Let's go.
-I'm coming.

404
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.560 
So Sang Zhi,

405
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.440 
you know when we'll meet next time, right?

406
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:19.880 
Bye.

407
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.560 
Close the gate when you leave.

408
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.320 
<i>Next time?</i>

409
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.480 
<i>Hold on.</i>

410
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.320 
<i>When will that be?</i>

411
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.120 
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

412
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.040 
<i>So is he coming tomorrow or not?</i>

413
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.800 
<i>Why didn't he give me an exact answer?</i>

414
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.240 
CHAPTER ONE, WAITING

415
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.000 
A SECRET KEPT

416
00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.880 
Mom.

417
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.440 
Good morning.

418
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.480 
Good morning.

419
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960 
Good morning.

420
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.320 
Good morning, Sang Zhi!

421
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.600 
Good morning.

422
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.840 
Little demon.

423
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.840 
-Can't you see me?
-What's for breakfast?

424
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920 
Hey!

425
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.640 
Little demon!

426
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.600 
Hi!

427
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.760 
Sang Yan, you're back.

428
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160 
Yes, this is my home.

429
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.440 
Why can't I come back?

430
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.600
{\an8}So you know this is your home?

431
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.120
{\an8}When was the last time you were back?

432
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.560 
You can ask Dad and Mom
if they still recognize you.

433
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.720 
I haven't seen you for a month

434
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.520 
and you're giving me this attitude?

435
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.520 
What attitude do you expect from me then?

436
00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.760 
<i>Welcome.</i>

437
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.360 
<i>A warm welcome to you.</i>

438
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.840 
<i>Welcome home, Sang Yan.</i>

439
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.040 
<i>Are you happy? Is this okay?</i>

440
00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.680 
-I'm happy.
<i>-Let me give you a big hand.</i>

441
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.040 
-Well, stop it.
-Enough.

442
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.680 
-That's enough.
-The egg crepe is ready.

443
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.920 
-That's too much.
-Sit down.

444
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.880 
Hurry and try the egg crepe with tuna

445
00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.120 
that your dad made for you.

446
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.560 
Nice.

447
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.320 
"My name is Sang Zhi
and this is how I talk."

448
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.120 
Stop making fun of her.

449
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.760 
-Come on.
-Eat up.

450
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.720 
Thank you, Dad.

451
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.120 
Dad, I'm moving back

452
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.680 
to the main campus.

453
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.440 
So I might need to borrow your car.

454
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.640 
Do you have a lot of things?

455
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.200 
I can get you a moving company.

456
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.880 
No, this is better than the campus bus.

457
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.480 
I remember that the main campus

458
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.280 
is near Zhizhi's school.

459
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.880 
You can pick up Zhizhi from school
from now on.

460
00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.880 
I'm in university now.

461
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.160 
I'm not babysitting her.

462
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.640 
I don't need him. I'm in 11th grade.

463
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.200 
That had best be the case.

464
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.960 
Dad, can I borrow your car this morning?

465
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.080 
I'm fetching my roommate's things too.

466
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.200 
Yes, as long as you don't bully Sang Zhi.

467
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.200 
Fine, I'll try to.

468
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:22.760 
Which roommate?

469
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.240 
Why do you ask?

470
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.160 
What do you want?

471
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.960 
Sang Yan, how about I help you move?

472
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.600 
Do you want to help me move?

473
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.200 
Did I mishear you?

474
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.560 
No, you didn't.

475
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.160 
You need to go to school.

476
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.600 
I can go after school.

477
00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.880 
You won't be done that early anyway.

478
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.000 
May I?

479
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.000 
Zhizhi.

480
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.400 
Your art science subject tests
are in a few days.

481
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.120 
You have to study at school.

482
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.440 
I've already done the revision.

483
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.760 
I can take a few days off.

484
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.120 
Do your revision.

485
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.720 
Besides, I'm sure
I'll have finished moving

486
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.080 
by the time you come.

487
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.760 
Mom, Dad.

488
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.880 
Sang Yan hasn't been home in a long time.

489
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.280 
I've been missing him so much.

490
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.360 
I'm grown up now

491
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.000 
and I should do something for him.

492
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.200 
Sang Yan, look how sincere she is.

493
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280 
Just let her help.

494
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.480 
-That's right.
-She won't affect your studies.

495
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.960 
Wait.

496
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.160 
How can she help? My things are heavy.

497
00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.400 
She can't move them at all.

498
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.080 
I'll have to keep her from getting hurt.

499
00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.080 
If she gets hurt,

500
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.920 
I'll be in big trouble when I come home.

501
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.760 
Just let her keep an eye on your things.

502
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.840 
Isn't that good?

503
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.640 
Fine, do what you like.

504
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.600 
I'll call you after school.

505
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.680 
Do you want this?

506
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.880 
I'm eating this.

507
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.840 
Hello.

508
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.280 
Hello.

509
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.320 
I'm here.

510
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.360 
You actually came?

511
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.840 
Where are you?

512
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.200 
<i>I'm too busy to come get you.</i>

513
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.160 
<i>Wait for me there.</i>

514
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.440 
Tell me where you are now.

515
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.440 
I'll come find you.

516
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000 
Block 9, Room 525.

517
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.960 
Block 9.

518
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.440 
Got it.

519
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.640 
Silly Dog.

520
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.520 
<i>It's Dad's car.</i>

521
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.400 
ISAAC ASIMOV: THE END OF ETERNITY

522
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.280 
DUAN

523
00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.640 
Busted, thief.

524
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.480 
Sang Zhi?

525
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960 
It has been some years.

526
00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.240 
I hardly recognized you.

527
00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.720 
I'm here to help my brother move.

528
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.240 
I know. He told me.

529
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.960 
But why did you only steal my things?

530
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.200 
Is this yours?

531
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.440 
Iâ€¦

532
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.160 
I didn't know it was yours.

533
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.240 
Had I known, I wouldn't have touched it.

534
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.840 
What do you mean by that?

535
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.200 
Kiddo, where is your conscience?

536
00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.320 
I did you a great favor.
Don't you remember?

537
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.160 
No.

538
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.400 
If you like this plushie, take it.

539
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.040 
I was kidding.

540
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.440 
I'm already in 11th grade.

541
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.880 
I don't play with plushies anymore.

542
00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.920 
I see.

543
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.680 
I'll throw it away then.

544
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.520 
Iâ€¦

545
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.880 
I can play with it for a while.

546
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.000 
Come on. I'll take you upstairs.

547
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.920 
You can take your brother's shoes.

548
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.120 
Let's go.

549
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.680 
Jiaxu.

550
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.760 
Did you get this fox plushie

551
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.280 
from someone else?

552
00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.360 
I think so.

553
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.800 
I can't remember.

554
00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.680 
We have to walk up five floors.

555
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.760 
Can you do it?

556
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.600 
This way.

557
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.440 
Sang Yan.

558
00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.040 
You said you were too busy to get me.

559
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.960 
You're not busy!

560
00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.760 
You just didn't want to come to get me.

561
00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.880 
I just finished up and sat down to rest.

562
00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.120 
No, you didn't.

563
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.480 
You didn't move at all.

564
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.120 
You didn't tidy up just now.

565
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.600 
Mom asked you to fetch me.

566
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.000 
-Give that to me.
-Sang Yan.

567
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.520 
Is this your sister?

568
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.200 
Yes.

569
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.160 
Greet Qian Fei.

570
00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.200 
Hello, Qian Fei. I'm Sang Zhi.

571
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.400 
Little girl,

572
00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.440 
you're so adorable!

573
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:16.120 
Keep your distance.

574
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.160 
It's our first meeting.

575
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.480 
Why can't I go near her?

576
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.600 
Besides, I'm short-sighted.

577
00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.640 
You'll scare her if you get too close.

578
00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.320 
I'm sorry about that.

579
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.840 
Don't be.

580
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.920 
Come here, little girl.

581
00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.520 
Sit over here.

582
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.960 
Sit over there.

583
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.080 
I'm not little.

584
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.760 
I said I'm not little.

585
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.440 
All right,

586
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.440 
girl.

587
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.840 
What do we have for dinner?

588
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.680 
We've finally moved here

589
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.000 
and your sister is here too.

590
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.360 
Let's not eat at the canteen.

591
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.800 
There's a good hot pot place in the mall.

592
00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.040 
What do you say?

593
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.440 
Let's eat barbecue.

594
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.200 
There's a food street off campus.

595
00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.200 
Let's try that out.

596
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960 
Hot pot, please.

597
00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.600 
Haven't you had enough barbecue?

598
00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.320 
DIRECT ADMISSION RECOMMENDATION

599
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.280 
Little demon.

600
00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.640 
Hey, little demon.

601
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.920 
Do you want a hot pot or barbecue?

602
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.640 
Jiaxu, let's have a hot pot tonight.

603
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.680 
You guys go.

604
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.040 
I have my part-time job later.

605
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.640 
Seriously, Jiaxu?

606
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.360 
Where are you going?

607
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.000 
Don't tell me you have a girlfriend.

608
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.400 
You can't be the only one dating.

609
00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.480 
-Introduce a girl to me.
-Introduce one to me first.

610
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.920 
Don't cut in line. Me first.

611
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.320 
Any girl who isn't hot-tempered.

612
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.440 
Any girl will do

613
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.640 
as long as she likes me.

614
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.160 
Qian Fei.

615
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.240 
My brother told me

616
00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.960 
all the girls in school pursued him.

617
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.960 
Well, little girl.

618
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.040 
I have never seen someone

619
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.160 
more thick-skinned than him!

620
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.320 
I suppose Sang Yan

621
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.800 
has been more handsome lately.

622
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.960 
Get away from me.

623
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.440 
You guys talk.

624
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:26.440 
I'm off.

625
00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.120 
Girl.

626
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.400 
If you like it, take it with you.

627
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.600 
Bye.

628
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.600 
<i>He's leaving so soon.</i>

629
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.880 
Duan Jiaxu hasn't thrown that away.

630
00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.960 
What's wrong with him?

631
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.160 
It's just a decoration on his bed.

632
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.600 
It's completely useless.

633
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.360 
By the way, Qian Fei.

634
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.360 
Does Jiaxu have a girlfriend?

635
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.000 
Did his girlfriend give him this?

636
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.360 
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

637
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.960 
He's busy every day

638
00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.480 
and has no time for dating.

639
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.920 
I think it was a prize from some event.

640
00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.600 
It was from last semester.

641
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.200 
If you don't like it, just leave it there.

642
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.800 
That dog must have made a fool of you.

643
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:33.640 
Dog?

644
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.120 
Don't you know?

645
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.320 
He and your brother are known

646
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.480 
as the Twin Dogs of Nanwu.

647
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.720 
I thought Sang Yan was the only dog.

648
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.240 
Enough of that.

649
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.800 
Do you want a hot pot or barbecue?

650
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.600 
Neither.

651
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.480 
What do you want?

652
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.720 
I'll drive you home after.

653
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.760 
No need. I want to go home now.

654
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.720 
I'm not eating.

655
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.040 
I can drive you home.

656
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.040 
I'll take the bus.

657
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.600 
Really?

658
00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.960 
Fine, it's almost time. Let's go.

659
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.920 
I'm leaving.

660
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.400 
-Bye!
-Bye. See you next time.

661
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.440 
"Asimov.

662
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.120 
<i>The End of Eternity</i>.

663
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.159 
But it resolves itself

664
00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.719 
into an identity.

665
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.239 
There is a loop of small dimensions

666
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.880 
with no tributaries

667
00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.199 
on either side."

668
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.040 
Can you understand this?

669
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.960 
Maybe this is the distance between us.

670
00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.480 
I can't understand the book he is reading.

671
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.720 
I only know the characters.

672
00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.360 
Sang Yan, how is your thesis coming along?

673
00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.600 
I need more references.

674
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.600 
-I'll go to the library tomorrow.
-You're focused.

675
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.040 
I haven't finished my thesis yet.

676
00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.480 
I haven't either.

677
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.480
{\an8}Why are you back?

678
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.760
{\an8}I brought some food for you.

679
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.320
{\an8}Help yourselves.

680
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.240
{\an8}-Okay.
-Sure.

681
00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.960 
It's all your fault.

682
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.520 
You're always bringing food from work.

683
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.160 
That's why I'm so chubby. I blame you.

684
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.520 
Jiaxu.

685
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.760 
My sister called me just now

686
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.280 
and said you left something with her.

687
00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.080 
Did I leave something with her?

688
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.080 
Hold on.

689
00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:37.840 
I'll call her.

690
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:43.680 
SILLY DOG

691
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.880 
<i>Did you find it?</i>

692
00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.800 
Kiddo.

693
00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.320 
<i>What did I leave behind with you?</i>

694
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.840 
No, you didn't leave something with me.

695
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.800 
I left something at your place.

696
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.000 
<i>What is it?</i>

697
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.760 
An exercise book.

698
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.640 
I'll ask Sang Yan

699
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.120 
to bring it to you tomorrow morning.

700
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.160 
But I haven't done my homework yet.

701
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.920 
Are you asking me to do it for you?

702
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.600 
No.

703
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.080 
It's because it's an essay.

704
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.080 
I might not have time to finish it.

705
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.640 
Why don't you ask Sang Yan
to do it for you?

706
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:34.080 
He would break my legs.

707
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.040 
Sang Zhi.

708
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.680 
This homework

709
00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.440 
is a task assigned by your teacher.

710
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.400 
You can be honest with the teacher,

711
00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.360 
apologize,

712
00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.960 
and say you will complete it afterward.

713
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.680 
You shouldn't ask someone
to do it for you.

714
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.960 
What time do you usually arrive at school?

715
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.000 
7:40 a.m.

716
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.560 
<i>7:40 a.m.</i>

717
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.400 
<i>So you wake up at 7:00 a.m.</i>

718
00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.520 
<i>Can you wake up at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow?</i>

719
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.960 
Why?

720
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.200 
Tomorrow,

721
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.000 
I'll wait for you at the bus stop
at 6:40 a.m.

722
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.320 
<i>I'll help you write the essay.</i>

723
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.320 
<i>Is that okay?</i>

724
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.720 
If so, you should plan out

725
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.200 
what you will write.

726
00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.320 
After that, wash up and go to bed.

727
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.680 
All right.

728
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.560 
<i>6:00 a.m.</i>

729
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.040 
<i>Remember to set the alarm.</i>

730
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.360 
<i>I'll call you then.</i>

731
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.600 
Go to sleep now.

732
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.640 
<i>Good night.</i>

-Your phone.
-What is it?

736
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.200 
What did you forget?

737
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.040 
It's trivial.

738
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.920 
What time are you going to the library?

739
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.040 
First thing in the morning.

740
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.160 
As early as possible.

741
00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.160 
Why so early?

742
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.400 
I need to organize my research topic

743
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.400 
to find breakthroughs for my arguments.

744
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.720 
That's quite a lot of work.

ESSAY BOOKLET

746
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.720 
That makes sense.

747
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.320 
Remember to wake me up tomorrow morning.

748
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:43.880 
Good night.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.360

XURI MIDDLE-HIGH SCHOOL

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.000 
<i>Why isn't he here yet?</i>

758
00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.920 
<i>Will he really come?</i>

759
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.120 
You can converse the theorem

760
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.480 
in this way too.

761
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.400 
Therefore, we call the two theorems

762
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.200 
reciprocal theorems.

763
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.240 
Learn the converse theorem by heart.

764
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.960 
<i>Does he know I finish class at 4:20 p.m.?</i>

765
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.320 
<i>I forgot to tell him.</i>

766
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.000 
For the triangle's legs,

767
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.320 
A squared plus B squared.

768
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.360 
<i>Is he not planning to come?</i>

769
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.480 
<i>Maybe I should have Sang Yan ask him.</i>

770
00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.760 
A squared plus B squaredâ€¦

771
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.760 
<i>That won't do.</i>

772
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.680 
<i>Sang Yan will find out.</i>

773
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.960 
You keep sighing throughout the lesson.

774
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.880 
Did I not explain it well enough?

775
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.080 
Did I sigh?

776
00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.560 
No,

777
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.600 
you didn't sigh.

778
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.520 
I sighed.

779
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.240 
Today's homework

780
00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.920 
will be the first ten questions

781
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.040 
in the booklet.

782
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.080 
Class dismissed.

783
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.440 
All rise.

784
00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.760 
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye, sir.

785
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.800 
Sang Zhi.

786
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.760 
I'll wait for your parents in the office.

787
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.720 
<i>Shoot.</i>

788
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.920 
<i>What should I do now?</i>

789
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.240 
<i>So Sang Zhi,</i>

790
00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.800 
you know when we'll meet next time, right?

791
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:18.320 
What did he mean?

792
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.640 
Will he come tomorrow?

793
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.400 
I'm Duan Jiaxu.

794
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.880 
Duan Jiaxu.

795
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.240 
How is it written?
